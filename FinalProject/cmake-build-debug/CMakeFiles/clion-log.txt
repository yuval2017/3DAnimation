CMake Error at tutorial/CMakeLists.txt:4 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgl3w.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gl3w", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gl3w" with any of
  the following names:

    gl3wConfig.cmake
    gl3w-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gl3w" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gl3w_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gl3w"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
